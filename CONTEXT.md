# Geode — Domain Glossary

Vocabulary for the 3D mantle volume viewer. Glossary only — no implementation
detail, no spec content. The spec lives in `tomography-globe-viewer-spec.md`.

## Model

A single named 3D field over the mantle, from one published source. Two kinds,
distinguished by whether they vary in time:

- **Tomography Model** — one static volume representing the present day.
  REVEAL, SEMUCB-WM1, S40RTS. Always exactly one Frame.
- **Convection Model** — a sequence of volumes representing a simulation
  evolving through geological time. gld37 and siblings. Many Frames.

*Out of scope for the first prototype: Convection Models.*

## Frame

One volume within a Model, tagged with the age it represents. A Tomography
Model has a single Frame at 0 Ma. The distinction between a Model and its
Frames exists so that a Tomography Model and a Convection Model are the same
kind of thing to everything downstream of ingest.

## Reconstruction Age

**Continuous**, in Ma, present = 0 and deeper time increasing. The age the
*surface* is drawn at: it selects which reconstructed coastline geometry
appears on the globe. It is a property of the view, not of any Model, and it
remains meaningful when the loaded Model is a static Tomography Model.

## Frame Index

**Discrete.** Identifies which Frame of a Convection Model is currently
rendered. Derived from Reconstruction Age by nearest available Frame age, never
set directly.

Reconstruction Age and Frame Index are deliberately separate concepts. They
were conflated in an earlier draft as a single "time slider", which hid the
fact that one is continuous and the other snaps to a model-specific, irregular
list of ages. When they disagree, the disagreement is shown, not smoothed over.

## Variable

One physical field carried by a Model — Vs anomaly, Vp anomaly, density. A
Model is a *source*, not a source-and-field pair: REVEAL is one Model carrying
several Variables, not seven Models. Variables of a Model share a grid and a
depth range, so switching between them changes what is painted on a Cutaway
without changing its geometry. They do not share units, polarity or sensible
colour ranges.

## Appearance Age / Disappearance Age

The bounds of a coastline feature's lifespan. Because ages increase into the
past, the **Appearance Age is the larger Ma value** — the moment the feature
comes into existence — and the Disappearance Age is the smaller. A feature is
drawn only when the Reconstruction Age falls between them.

The words "earlier" and "later" are avoided throughout for these: earlier in
geological time means a *larger* number, which reads backwards to most people
and has caused the test to be written inverted more than once.

## Volume

The regularly gridded, resampled 3D array that a Frame becomes after ingest —
equirectangular in longitude and latitude, uniformly spaced in depth. The
canonical form everything in the viewer consumes. A Volume is always uniform in
depth even though no source model on disk is.

## Cutaway

The region of mantle removed from view so the interior can be seen. Defined by
a closed spherical polygon and a depth to which the removal extends.

## Wall

The surface exposed by a Cutaway: the vertical curtain hanging from the surface
down to the cut depth, along the Cutaway polygon boundary. What the Volume is
actually painted onto.

## Mask

The rasterised footprint of the Cutaway polygon, used to hide the parts of the
surface and coastlines that fall inside it. An implementation of the Cutaway's
effect on the surface, not a separate concept from it.
